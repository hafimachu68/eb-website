                 Liwa Autogarages, with nearly six branches across Dubai, faced several challenges with their existing attendance management system. The main issue was the inaccurate tracking of employee working hours, including overtime and compensatory offs, which often led to payroll discrepancies. Additionally, the lack of integration between their current system and other HR processes made managing attendance across multiple branches cumbersome and inefficient. The outdated interface further complicated usage for both employees and HR staff, leading to frequent errors and frustration. These challenges negatively affected operational efficiency and employee satisfaction, making it difficult for Liwa Autogarages to manage attendance accurately across their branches.                 </p>

                 <p className="para1 pt-2">
                 To address the challenges faced by Liwa Autogarages, ExpressBase developed a custom attendance management software specifically tailored to their multi-branch operations in Dubai. The solution accurately tracks employee working hours, including overtime, special overtime, and compensatory offs, ensuring precise payroll processing. Integrated with punching machines at each branch, the system automatically records attendance data and stores it in a centralized database, offering real-time access to detailed reports. A standout feature of the solution is its ability to manage mid-month employee transfers between branches. This ensures that punch-in and punch-out data for transferred employees are seamlessly updated and accessible across branches, without disrupting payroll or attendance tracking. The user-friendly interface improves ease of use for both employees and HR staff, reducing errors and enhancing efficiency. With this tailored software, Liwa Autogarages can now manage attendance with precision, streamline operations, and maintain control across their six branches.                  </p>
