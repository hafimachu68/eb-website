                 <p className="para1 pt-2">
                 The most pressing issue is the inaccuracy in time tracking, which leads to discrepancies in recorded working hours, causing problems with payroll and employee dissatisfaction. Additionally, the software lacks integration capabilities with other HR and payroll systems, resulting in redundant data entry and a higher risk of errors. This inefficiency increases the administrative burden on the HR team. Furthermore, the user interface is outdated and not user-friendly, making it difficult for employees and HR staff to navigate and use effectively.                 </p>
